# Plugins Marketplace

Welcome to the Heaven Plugin Marketplace. Here you will find "Official Recipes" — plugins that are essential for many applications but are kept out of the core to ensure the framework remains lightweight and fast.

You can simply copy and paste these into your project (e.g., in a `plugins.py` file).

### Official Recipes

> [!NOTE]
> **CORS** and **Sessions** are now native core features!
> Check out [The Router](router.md#core-features-cors--sessions) documentation for details.
